Chorus
==========================

*Towards an open source tool stack for e-commerce search*

Chorus makes deploying powerful ecommerce search easier by shifting the buy vs build decision in favour of build, so you can own your search! It deals with three issues:

1. **Our collaboration stinks** Making holistic progress on search requires deep, cross-functional collaboration. Shooting emails or tracking search requirements in spreadsheets won't cut it.

2. ***Search testing is hard*** Search changes are cross-cutting: most changes will cause problems. Testing is difficult: you can't run hundreds of searches after every relevance change.

3. **Iterations are slow** Moving forward seems impossible. To avoid sliding backwards, progress is slow. Many simply give up on search, depriving users of the means to find critical information.

# 5 Minutes to Run Chorus!

We are trying to strike a balance between making the setup process as easy and fool proof as possible with the need to not _hide_ too much of the interactions between the projects that make up Chorus.

If you are impatient, we have a quick start script, `./quickstart.sh` that sets you up, however I recommend you go through [Kata 0: Setting up Chorus](katas/000_setting_up_chorus.md).   

After that, you can learn how to use the tools in Chorus to improve search in [First Kata: Lets Optimize a Query](katas/001_optimize_a_query.md).




# Useful Commands for Chorus

To start your environment, i.e to do each step manually, run:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
Otherwise you can just run `./quickstart.sh`.

To see what is happening in the Chorus stack you can tail the logs for all the components via:
```
docker-compose logs -tf
```

If you want to narrow down to just one component of the Chorus stack do:
```
docker-compose ps                       # list out the names of the components
docker-compose logs -tf solr1 solr2     # tail solr1 and solr2 only
```

To reset your environment (including any volumes created like the mysql db), just run:
```
docker-compose down -v
```

If Docker is giving you a hard time then some options are:
```
docker system prune                     # removes orphaned images, networks, etc.
docker system prune -a --volumes        # removes all images, clears out your Docker diskspace if you full.
```
